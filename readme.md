# BlackBarsNever Kodi Addon - Remove black bars
# How it works
This is an addon that eliminates black bars on KODI, whether hardcoded or the video is just wide format

With addon installed and enabled, it will automatically analyze media on playback and determine 
if there are any black bars. The addon will then zoom the media exactly enough to cover the display.

The picture will not be distorted in any way as the zoom is linear,
however, on most media, small parts on the left and right will be cut off. Luckily, everything that's 
important tends to fall in the middle of tbe scene most of the time. The advantages of experiencing an 
immersive picture that fills the periphery should be enough to overweigh the disdvantage of missing sides.
